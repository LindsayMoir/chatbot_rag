T. mcraeensis is considered to be an early ancestor of T. rex, representing an earlier stage in the evolution of the Tyrannosaurus genus.\n"

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "ChatGPT unassisted is amazingly good at lying. When it does not know the answer, it simply dreams something up. Since, ChatGPT is  so good at lying and it is trained on a large corpus, some of its \"lies\" may actually be truths. Just because it happened sometime on or before January 2022 does not mean it is not true today. It still could be true and part of a valid response. \n",
    "\n",
    "When I asked ChatGPT with RAG to restrict its answers to the input text it did not lie anymore and ws very accurate. I ran this code several times and on average ChatGPT 3.5 Unassisted got ~ 30% wrong. That is almost certainly a problem for most Chatbot applications. ChatGPT 3.5 With RAG was always correct but ... could not answer the question completely sometimes because the question posed by ChatGPT 3.5 Unassisted wanted information that was not in the RAG prompt. This was not common but did happen. \n",
    "\n",
    "When giving the LLM context, I did not return more than one result with this implementation. It is common to return the top several results to give the Large Language Model (LLM) more to work with. Since the sample size was so small and the individual pieces of information on the page were not expected to be closesly related, this is fine. However, depending on the application this may not be and would probably require some more prompt engineering to make sure that the application performed consistently well. "
